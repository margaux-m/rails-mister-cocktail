# Shaker

Shaker is a cocktail manager: a cookbook-type of app where you can store your favourite cocktail
recipes and edit them. You can add a new recipe, see the list of all your cocktails, read their
recipes and leave review notes.

Shaker is built with Ruby on Rails app, is deployed on Heroku and uses Cloudinary to store images.

The available ingredients to choose for the recipes were seeded from an API endpoint. I used Select2
to dynamically filter the results from that list of ingredients and Cloudinary to allow
users to upload an image for each cocktail recipe.
